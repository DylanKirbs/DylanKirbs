👋 Hey there! I'm Dylan Kirby, an enthusiastic Computer Science undergrad at Stellenbosch University 🎓. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science 📊🖥️. 

🧠 My passion lies at the intersection of code and creativity. When I'm not diving deep into Java, Python, R, and GIT for my coursework, you'll find me exploring the world of open source and tinkering with exciting projects.

💡 Beyond the classroom, I enjoy sharing knowledge as a tutor for fellow students and offering guidance to newcomers in my residence. As an active member of the Social and Environmental Impact Committee, I'm dedicated to giving back to the community through initiatives like river clean-ups and food drives. 🌱

💼 I've also dipped my toes into the professional world, working part-time as an information technology consultant at The Institute for Mindfulness of South Africa. My role has strengthened my skills in WordPress and Mailchimp while contributing to the organization's digital presence.

🚀 Always seeking growth and learning, I've built a strong foundation in software development and data analysis. From mastering GIT to crafting solutions in Java, Python, and R, I'm ready to tackle challenges and create innovative solutions.

🧮 Mathematics and I go way back – my deep understanding of linear algebra and other mathematical concepts has been refined through both academics and extracurricular research.

🌟 Passionate about staying ahead of the curve, I'm a firm believer in continuous learning. My curiosity for emerging technologies and trends fuels my commitment to professional development, ensuring I'm always ready to take on new and exciting challenges.

Let's connect and collaborate on the next big thing in tech! 🚀👾 #CodeExplorer #TechEnthusiast #OpenSourceAdvocate
