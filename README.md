👋 Hey! I'm Dylan Kirby, a Computer Science student at Stellenbosch University 🎓. I thrive on solving complex problems and building creative, functional tech solutions. Whether it's coding in Python, Rust, JavaScript, or working on innovative projects, I’m all about blending technical depth with creative flair.

🖥️ **What I'm Up To:**  
- At university, I'm focused on coursework involving **Python**, **Java**, **TypeScript**, and **Git** while honing my expertise in software development and systems thinking.  
- As part of the **Helshoogte Mens Residence House Committee**, I manage our **Room Points System**, streamlining operations with efficient, tech-forward solutions.  

🌍 **Outside the Classroom:**  
- I'm all about giving back. From mentoring fellow students to managing digital systems in my residence, I’m always looking for ways to create impact.  
- I also have a knack for turning big ideas into functional tools—like **When & Where**, an event management platform, or **NoteFlow**, a collaborative markdown editor inspired by Obsidian.  

🚀 **Tech Geek Vibes:**  
- Obsessed with open-source tech, I've fully transitioned to **NixOS** for its declarative, stable setups. My Linux setup keeps my workflow sharp and efficient.  
- I experiment with **containers** (Docker+Traefik) and **virtualization** (Proxmox) while optimizing projects in languages like Rust for performance-critical applications.  

🎧 **Creative Side:**  
- I dabble in music reconstruction using Linux MIDI tools, focusing on creating dynamic and spacious soundscapes.  

📈 **Beliefs:**  
- I value **open collaboration**, **customization**, and modular, maintainable code. Whether it’s tweaking themes in React or designing a new system, I chase both functionality and aesthetics.  
- Always curious, I'm driven by the idea of **learning by doing**—breaking things, fixing them, and coming out smarter on the other side.  

Let's connect, innovate, and bring cool ideas to life! 🚀 #OpenSourceAdvocate #CodeCooker #LinuxPowerUser
